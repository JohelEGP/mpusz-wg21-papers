# My ISO C++ Committee (WG21) papers

This repo contains ISO C++ Committee (WG21) papers that I created or co-authored with other C++ experts.

[src](src) directory contains source version of those documents. They are written in markdown-like
language and are using [Bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed) for their processing.

Generated outcome documents can be found on [GitHub IO](https://mpusz.github.io/wg21_papers) page.
